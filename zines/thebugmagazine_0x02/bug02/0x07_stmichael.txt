[ --- 1. Introduction

   Linux operating system is not secure, by default. There have been many
approaches to improve its security features. Most of them don't protect the
kernel mode itself, so a malicious program, acting like win32 worms, can inject
code into the kernel to change the system features.

This work intends to show StMichael [1] project, which aims to provide this
kind of protection at kernel-level, performing lots of integrity checks in ker-
nel internal structures and defeating the different kinds of attacks against
it. StMichael [1] is a LKM [2] that provides this protection by monitoring
various portions of the kernel, and optionally the entire kernel text itself,
for modifications that may indicate the presence of a malicious kernel module.
If rootkit-like activity is detected, StMichael will attempt to recover the
kernel's integrity by rolling back the changes made to a previously known-good
state.

The following is a brief list of the capabilities of StMichael kernel module:

- Can generate and check MD5 and, optionally, SHA1 checksum of several kernel
  data structures, such as the system call table, and filesystem call out
  structures;

- Can checksum (MD5 only) the base kernel, and detect modifications to the
  kernel text such as would occur during a silvo-type attack;

- Can backup a copy of the kernel, storing it in an encrypted form, for resto-
  ring later if a catastrophic kernel compromise is detected;

- Can detect the presence of simplistic kernel rootkits upon loading;

- Can modify the Linux kernel to protect immutable files from having their
  immutable attribute removed;

- Can disable write-access to kernel memory through the /dev/{k}mem device;
 
- Can conceal StMichael module and its symbols;

- Can monitor kernel modules being loaded and unloaded to detect attempts to
  conceal the module and its symbols and attempt to "reveal" the hidden module.


[ --- 2. Troubles and Solutions

   This section presents some common issues related to rootkit attacks, and
their respective solutions as implemented by StMichael kernel module.

[ --- 2.1. File modification attacks

   Linux has the chattr tool to change the attribute of a file. When an "chattr
+i" is issued on a file, that file can not be changed or removed anymore, be-
cause it becomes immutable. But root user can simply do "chattr -i" in this
file, and then remove it.

StMichael [1] implements a concept called "really immutable". This feature does
not permit an immutable file to be mutable again. The following steps show how
StMichael does that:

   - it hooks the VFS ioctl call:

     current->files->fd[fd]->f_op->ioctl = (void *) sm_ext2_ioctl;

   - it tests the call flags:

      if (inode->u.ext2_i.i_flags & S_IMMUTABLE)

   - and sets it again:

     flags |= S_IMMUTABLE;

   - then returns the original call:

     return orig_ext2_ioctl (inode, filp, cmd, arg);


Lots of files need to be write-protected. A list of files recommended to be set
immutable when using StMichael is included in StMichael's Docs/ subdir.
This list is just a sample for a generic system. It can be necessary to add,
remove, or change this list to fit it to a specific system.
The goal of this list is to set immutable every file in a prior moment to the
actual loading of StMichael LKM. This is done by simply run: "chattr +i
filename"

The file list includes:

   - the kernel images listed in /etc/lilo.conf. If using grub, setting as
     immutable all files in /boot/grub directory will prevent the attacks
     against grub presented by [3].

    /boot/*vmlinuz*
    /boot/*System.map*
    /vmlinuz*
    /System.map*

   - the configuration files that affect the loading of the kernel:

    /etc/lilo.conf

   - the binary programs that are run by the kernel, prior to and during the
     load of StMichael:

    /sbin/insmod
    /sbin/init

   - the configuration files used by these programs:

    /etc/inittab

   - the libraries the programs use:

    /lib/libc.*
    /lib/libc-*
    /lib/ld-*
    /lib/i[3456]86/libc*

   - the configuration files for the linker:

    /etc/ld.so.conf

   - the creation, if necessary, and definiton as immutable is done by doing:

    touch /etc/ld.so.preload
    chattr +i /etc/ld.so.preload

The preload configuration file may be used to introduce malicious libraries
into the preload sequence of dynamically linked programs. This is bad.

   - all modules located at:

    /lib/modules/`uname -r`


[ --- 2.2. Self protection

   After loaded, StMichael [1] removes itself from the modules list, and thus
destructs itself with the kernel locked:

-- snip --

        // This function will self destruct in 5
        // miliseconds...

        unsigned long filler = 0x00000000;
        unsigned long *p;

        for (p = (unsigned long *) &m; p < (unsigned long *) &filler; p++) {
              *p = filler;
        }

        sjp_l_bzero((void *) (THIS_MODULE), sizeof(struct module));

-- snip --

It also uses encrypted messages to avoid signature detection of StMichael's
code:

-- snip --

        char *sm_message_strings[] = {
                                  "Failed to Initilize.\n",
                                  "Evasion of Filesystem Checks Detected.\n",
                                  "Covert Kernel Module Detected. Revealed.\n",
                                   ...
                                  }

-- snip --

And then it uses encryption/decryption functions with random keys. These keys
are generated during the load of the module, so no one, including the admin-
istrator of the system, knows the key:

-- snip --

char *sjp_l_decrypt_data (char *p, long len)

void sjp_l_crypt_data (char *p, long size)

-- snip --


Of course it is necessary to implement all the string functions, like
'void sjp_l_free( void * memory, unsigned long size)', which calls do_munmap
directly, not relying in really easily hooked functions.
Also 'void * sjp_l_malloc(unsigned long size)', which calls do_mmap directly,
must be implemented. Many others have been implemented and are referenced in
StMichael string_util.c file.


[ --- 2.3. MBR Protection

   As spooted at Phrack 63 [3], an attacker can inject code onto the MBR of the
system (by attacking grub itself) to load an arbitrary backdoor into the kernel
code, before StMichael or the system [1] has been loaded.

To avoid this kind of attack, StMichael provides the MBR protection mechanism.
It's just a simple function, 'mbr_read', that reads the MBR contents and save
it in a buffer, to be hashed and checked.


[ --- 2.4. System calls

   StMichael [1] also hooks some system calls like create_module, delete_module
and init_module. These are the reasons:

  - create module is hooked to put kmem as read-write before registering the
    module and add the new module into the StMichael list;

  - init module is hooked to check the system integrity after loading the
    module;

  - delete module is hooked to check the integrity after module has been
    removed and unregistered with StMichael. Also checks if the deleted
    module is not a try to delete StMichael itself;

  - exit is hooked to check the integrity of the system after a process exits.


[ --- 2.5. Installation

   The StMichael [1] kernel module needs to be configured prior to its build-
ing. A "configure" script is included to generate its configuration. After
running "./configure", new configuration is stored in a "Makefile.in" file.
This file is called by Makefile to set the definitions that control the compi-
lation process. Once the Makefile.in file has been generated, running "make"
does the build of the kernel module.

The  module can be tested by running "insmod ./StMichael.o". This loads the
StMichael kernel module with the configuration earlier defined. If everything
appears to work properly, it is recommended to play with some of the demo
attack scripts.

When deploying StMichael to a system, the module must be loaded at the first
possible moment. This can be done by loading the module prior to entering the
initial runlevel. This is accomplished by adding the following line to
'/etc/inittab', assuming the compiled StMichael.o file has been copied to
'/lib/modules'. This line should be added before rc.sysinit script is called.
After loaded, StMichael outputs events to the kernel logging facility.

        sm:35:once:/sbin/insmod
        /lib/modules/StMichael.o

An important question when talking about a security module is how can it be
securely loaded at boot time?
If the attacker tries to remove the module, perhaps rebooting the system, how
resistant will it be? If the attacker uses some way to insert a backdoor in the
early stage of the booting, will the system enforce the security?

The way StMichael works requires it to be loaded earlier in the boot process,
in order to protect the system from hostile acts. The earlier in the boot pro-
cess it loads, the better.

In some situations, particularly when '/bin/init' can be trojaned, it is neces-
sary to load the modules prior to init spawning. Within Linux, the only way to
load a kernel module prior to init spawning is through initrd [11] (initial
ramdisk).

When loaded through initrd, StMichael can easily detect malicious activity done
by the programs which load before it. Additionally, on systems already compro-
mised by a kernel level rootkit, a pre-built initrd can be loaded through lilo
(or grub) interface. By doing this, StMichael is loaded before the kernel
rootkit and is able to detect it, speeding up the recovery from this kind of
attack. The following items describe the steps to load StMichael through initrd
are.

   1) Configure and compile the modules with the symbol extraction;

       ./configure && make thing

   2) Copy the module StMichael to operating system's
      /lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel directory;

   3) Run "depmod -a";

   4) Change directory to /boot directory;

   5) Run "mkinitrd ­with StMichael lkm initrd-

       sm.img `uname -r`";

   6) Modify lilo or grub to use initrd, as in the following examples; Lilo
      Example (lilo.conf):

       prompt
       timeout=50
       default=linux-with-stmichael
       boot=/dev/hda
       map=/boot/map
       install=/boot/boot.b
       message=/boot/message
       linear
       image=/boot/2.4.19-pre1/vmlinuz
       label=linux-without-stmichael
       read-only
       root=/dev/hda6
       append="hdc=ide-scsi"
       image=/boot/2.4.19-pre1/vmlinuz
       label=linux-with-stmichael
       read-only
       root=/dev/hda6
       append="hdc=ide-scsi"
       initrd=
       /boot/2.4.19-pre1/initrd-sm.img

   Grub Example (menu.lst):
 
       default 0
       timeout 50
       color cyan/blue white/blue
       title StMichael Modified Kernel
       root    (hd0,4)
       kernel /boot/vmlinuz-2.4.31 \
       root=/dev/hda5 ro
       initrd /boot/initrd.img-2.4.31
       savedefault
       boot
       title Original Distro Kernel
       root (hd0,4)
       kernel /boot/vmlinuz-2.4.31 \
       root=/dev/hda5 ro
       savedefault
       boot

7) Reboot.


[ --- 2.6. Demo attacks

   The DEMO ATTACKS directory contains interesting attack situations that
tries to defeat StMichael [1] protections. All these attacks have been issued
and solved by a StMichael feature. The next subsections analyse them.

1) printk exploit.c

This exploit tries to modify printk to discover and spot StMichael by running
arbitrary code. That's why StMichael implements 'int sjp_l_printf(const char*
fmt,...)'.
Indeed, this function relies on sys write, but sys call table is protected by
the integrity code. printk address is also protected, but the attack uses code
injection, not address modification.

2) test attack.c:

This attack uses five different approaches:

     - Hide the module;

     - Execute code during the loading of the module;

     - Change the sys call table;

     - Change an specific function address;

     - Overwrite the function called by delete module system call with an
       invalid address '0xdeadbeef '


StMichael has anti-lkm concealment, that detects the modules trying to hide it.
It has interesting stuff that tries to discover modules changing an address not
contained in itself and some other important implementations. The attack to
StMichael itself causes a kernel panic, not a system compromise.


3) timer exploit.c:

This exploit is really interesting. Some systems rely on the system timer so it
executes in a pre-defined ticks of time. This attack tries to define a backdoor
that uses this to remove the backdoor when the system will check kernel inte-
grity, and then put it back after the check. StMichael uses a randomly timer to
prevent this kind of attack.


[ --- 3. StMichael Internals

This section presents some questions about StMichael internals. These questions
were compiled by Yan Harry. Following each of them are the respective answers:

   1) In the following codes about sys call table in StJude lkm.c file, why the
      address of sys_call_table is between &loops_per_jiffy and &boot_cpu_data?

      -- snip --

      sys_call_table = NULL;
      for (ptr = (unsigned long) & loops_per_jiffy;
           ptr < (unsigned long) &boot_cpu_data;
           ptr += sizeof(void *))
      {
      
      unsigned long *p;
      p = (unsigned long *) ptr;
      if (p[1] == (unsigned long) sys_exit)
      {
            sys_call_table = (void **) p;
            break;
      }

      }

      -- snip --

   Answer:

     a) Loops per jiffy and boot cpu data are exported;

     b) The address of sys call table is between loops_per_jiffy and
        boot_cpu_data. This can be seen in System.map file;

     c) The second syscall into sys_call_table is sys_exit.

   For i386 platform, the definitions are as follows:

     - sys_call_table is defined in 'arch/i386/kernel/entry.s';

     - loops_per_jiffy is defined in 'init/main.c' file:

        unsigned long loops_per_jiffy =
        (1<<12);

     -  boot_cpu_data is defined in 'arch/i386/kernel/setup.c' file:

        /*common cpu data for all cpus*/
        struct cpuinfo_x86
        boot_cpu_data __read_mostly =
        { 0, 0, 0, 0, -1, 1, 0, 0, -1 };
        EXPORT_SYMBOL(boot_cpu_data);


2) Can StMichael [1] detect rootkits which redirect the system call table, such
   as SuckIT [9] rootkit?

   This type of rootkit keeps the original system call
   table intact.

   Answer: Yes. StMichael doesn't only look at sys_call_table. It checks the
   integrity of many parts of the kernel: if the sys_call_table[] pointers
   point to a kernel text area, the integrity of the functions called itself,
   among others.


3) In the following codes about sj_s_text and sj_e_text in init module() func-
   tion, sj_s text is the start of kernel text and PAGE_OFFSET is OXC0000000 on
   i386 platform in Linux kernel;
   sj_e_text is the end of kernel text. Why were sj_s_text and sj_e_text compu-
   ted that way?

   (1) sj_s_text = (void*)(PAGE_OFFSET | 0x00100000);
   (2) for (m=*eml; m->next; m=m->next);
   (3) for (s=m->syms; s->name; s++);
   (4) sj_e_text = (void *) s;

   Answer: At line 1 sj_s_text is pointed to the start of kernel text.
           PAGE_OFFSET -- 0x00100000 returns the init of the kernel text:
           PAGE_OFFSET(0XC0000000) - THE START OF VIRTUAL KERNEL SPACE. All
           normal kernel code in vmlinuz is compiled with the base address at
           PAGE OFFSET + 1MiB, the kernel is actually loaded beginning at the
           first megabyte (0x00100000) of memory. The first megabyte is used by
           some devices for communication with BIOS and is skipped. Lines 2 and
           3 will loop through the modules structures until the end of them and
           the symbols/names. At line 4 sj_e_text is pointed to the end of ker-
           nel text, because a sys call table address not being between
           sj_s_text and sj_e_text was certainly modified.
           Both sj_s_text and sj_e_text are used in the macro IS_IN_KERNEL_TEXT
           as that macro checks if the address of the syscalls are into the
           correct place without need to hash or check each address (merely an
           approach used at the load).

4) It has been noticed sys_call_table symbol is used to replace system calls,
   but sys_call_table isn't exported in Linux 2.6.*, so how system calls in
   Linux 2.6.* can be modified?

   Answer: The method is in StJude lkm.c file.
   Refer to question 1.

5) /dev/kmem was disabled to be part of StMichael. This can possibly affect the
   following normal function [8]:

      a) Some boot loaders, such as lilo, need to access /dev/mem or /dev/kmem
         for getting BIOS data;

      b) klogd uses such access, probably for decoding oops messages (it can
         probably operate fine without it for some loss of functionality);

      c) vmware uses such access (and lots of other invasive access types to
         kernel memory);

      d) many xdm type programs read kernel memory as a source of randomness.
         This is bad because kernel memory is not random and it may leak some
         information from the kernel. xdm in Fedora should be fixed to use
         /dev/random;

      e) X server needs such access if it's accessing the hardware directly.
         When using fbdev it should not need such access.

      Answer: No one needs to write into /dev/kmem. Applications 1-4 are just
              getting info from /dev/kmem using read operation. There are prob-
              lems with old X servers and PaX [5] patchs because /dev/kmem
              write needed... It doesn't exist anymore.

6) It was found out that both StJude [1] and StMichael work only with Linux
   2.2.* and 2.4.*. Is there any plan to make it work for Linux 2.6.*?

   Answer: Yes. The work on that has started, as can be seen in [6]. Next ver-
           sion will be for 2.6 kernel. The plan is to maintain a 2.2/2.4 ver-
           sion and another for 2.6 (it's not desired to keep backward compati-
           bilities because 2.6 kernel has changed a lot of its module constru-
           ction).

7) What are the difficulties in the port to Linux 2.6.*?

   Answer: Time is the major difficult. Version 2.6 has changed the module
           construction and a lot of structures. A lot of others has been
           added. It's necessary to check LSM integrity too - it already exists
           in the draft coded for [6].

8) Is there any more detailed document about StJude and StMichael projects
   available, with exception of documents from
   http://sourceforge.net/projects/stjude?
   
   Answer: No. The documentation provided explains all the ideas behind the
           modules and the model. The code itself is documented to explain the
           code structure and technical details of the project. "On Intrusion
           Resilience" [7] is the original idea and the initial concepts that
           justify the creation of StMichael. This document intends to be an
           useful documentation.

9) Why are there many functions replacing standard system functions in StJude
   string util.c? For example, sjp_l_strlen replaces strlen.

   Answer: Because the original strlen is exported by the kernel. So, a cracker
           can hook that and thus break StJude checks. It's like the comment in
           the printf function: "This is a more secure replacement for printk.
           It's a local function to this module and its address isn't exported
           to the kernel, so it isn't so easy to modify as printk".


[ --- 4. Issues and Incompatibilities

  This section presents known issues and incompatibilities between StMichael[1]
and other kernel patches and modules.


[ --- 4.1. PCMCIA-CS

   There have been some issues with PCMCIA-CS [10] and StMichael. It seems that
when PCMCIA-CS modules are loaded into the kernel, the system call table is
modified. These are legitimate modifications. Similarly, when PCMCIA-CS modules
(including autoclean) are removed from the kernel, these system calls are remo-
ved.

In the first case, the fact that StMichael flags these as rootkit activity and
reverses the changes has little effect other than disabling the PCMCIA subsys-
tem.

In the latter case, the effects can be catastrophic. If calls are made to the
system call, the entry that is in the system call table points to unallocated
portions of data. The effects of calling this can range from oopsing the system
to opening a potential avenue for malicious code to be executed.

To exploit this, malicious code has to be overlayed on top of the exact place
where the original PCMCIA functions were. This is considered from difficult to
non-trivial, but possible.

It is not recommended, at this time, to use StMichael on a laptop that loads
kernel modules for PCMCIA support, or any other service that installs or remo-
ves new system calls.


[ --- 4.2. Grate security

   If loaded on a system that is using a grate security kernel patch, like
GrSecurity [4], StMichael may oops. This oops occurs on kernel loading. At this
time, the cause of the problem is unknown.


[ --- 4.3. AC kernels

   Alan Cox kernel series seem to have made modifications to the 2.4.XX kernel
memory manager. These modifications may conflict with StMichael and cause its
compilation to fail.

StMichael 0.10 has been modified to work with the 2.4.19-pre3-ac3 kernel patch.
The compile time option -DACKERNEL turns on this support.

Depending on the changes in future AC kernels, other issues may crop up.


[ --- 5. Conclusion

   It was presented StMichael [1], a kernel-level security tool for Linux ope-
rating system. StMichael's internals were showed in detail, since its installa-
tion and use process to developer questions about its source code.
So this document is considered to be unique in the literature.

An interesting feature of StMichael is its self-protection mechanism. Several
other tools that aim to protect every kind of systems are not able to protect
themselves. Other intersting features are MBR protection and demo attack appli-
cations.

Due to its consistent security model, StMichael can be applied to systems that
require a strong security level, since Linux kernel 2.4 series are not an
